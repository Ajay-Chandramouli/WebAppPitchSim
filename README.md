# WebAppPitchSim
This repository contains the codes used to build the web app for pitch angle misalignment simulation (chandramouli.pythonanywhere.com) and some MATLAB codes used in my thesis. 

- The files and codes on the first level are used in building the web app

- The folder 'Turbine Analysis Python' contains code written to build a Recurring Neural Network Model to predict expected bearing temperature as a function of Turbine operating parameters such as Power, Torque etc.

- The folder 'MATLAB Thesis scripts' contains some code written to read data from the binary files from HAWC2 simulations and store them as processed .mat files. There are other codes that then operate on this processed data and do calculations on them to produce various results. All scripts written for analysis of thesis data is not included, mostly for confidentiality reasons.

Naturally, most of the codes inside will have links to local folders in my computer because that is where I developed the scripts and stored the required files.
